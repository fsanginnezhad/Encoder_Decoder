# ROT13 Encoder/Decoder

A simple Python program that implements the ROT13 cipher for encoding and decoding text.

## What is ROT13?
ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places") is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. It's a special case of the Caesar cipher.

## Features
- Encodes and decodes any text input
- Case-sensitive (preserves uppercase and lowercase)
- Simple interactive interface
- Handles all alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z)
- Easy to exit the program

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script
2. Enter the text you want to encode/decode
3. The program will output the ROT13 converted text
4. To exit, type any of these: q, e, exit, quit
   - You'll be asked to confirm before exiting

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
No installation required. Just run the script directly:
```bash
python rot13.py
Example
text
Enter Your Text: Hello World
Uryyb Jbeyq
Enter Your Text: Uryyb Jbeyq
Hello World
Why ROT13?
ROT13 is commonly used in online forums to hide spoilers, punchlines, and offensive material. It's also useful for simple obfuscation where no real security is needed.
